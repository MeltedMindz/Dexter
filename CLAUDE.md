### Error Handling
All async operations should use proper error handling:
```python
try:
    async with connector as conn:
        data = await conn.fetch_liquidity_data(pool_address)
except Exception as e:
    await error_handler.handle_error(e, context="operation_name")
```

### Configuration Usage
```python
# Get agent-specific configuration
agent_config = Settings.get_agent_config('conservative')
min_liquidity = agent_config['min_liquidity']

# Validate configuration
Settings.validate()  # Raises ValueError if invalid
```
