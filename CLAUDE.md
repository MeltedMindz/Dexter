## Development Notes

### Import Patterns
Use the enhanced modular structure:

**Backend/ML Imports:**
```python
# DexBrain imports
from dexbrain.core import DexBrain
from dexbrain.config import Config
from dexbrain.models import KnowledgeBase, DeFiMLEngine, EnhancedMLModels
from dexbrain.enhanced_ml_models import LSTMModel, TickRangePredictor

# Data quality imports
from data.data_quality_monitor import DataQualityMonitor, DataQualityMetrics
from data.historical_backfill_service import HistoricalBackfillService

# Liquidity system imports  
from config.settings import Settings
from utils.performance_tracker import PerformanceTracker, PerformanceMetrics
```

**Frontend Imports:**
```typescript
// Position management
import { PositionManager } from '@/components/PositionManager'
import { EnhancedPortfolioOverview } from '@/components/EnhancedPortfolioOverview'

// Vault management
import VaultDashboard from '@/components/VaultDashboard'
import VaultFactory from '@/components/VaultFactory'
import VaultList from '@/components/VaultList'

// Web3 integration
import { useAccount, useReadContract, useWriteContract } from 'wagmi'
import { alchemyBase, getTokenBalances } from '@/lib/alchemy'

// SEO and utilities
import { generateSEOMetadata, pageSEO } from '@/lib/seo'
```

### Error Handling
All async operations should use proper error handling:
```python
try:
    async with connector as conn:
        data = await conn.fetch_liquidity_data(pool_address)
except Exception as e:
    await error_handler.handle_error(e, context="operation_name")
```

### Configuration Usage
```python
# Get agent-specific configuration
agent_config = Settings.get_agent_config('conservative')
min_liquidity = agent_config['min_liquidity']

# Validate configuration
Settings.validate()  # Raises ValueError if invalid
```
