## 🚀 New Actions & Capabilities

### **Enhanced Market Analysis**
```
User: "Give me a comprehensive market analysis"
Dexter: 🔍 **AI-Powered Market Analysis**
• Market Sentiment: Bullish 📈
• AI Predictions: Multiple tokens showing strength - potential alt season
• Trading Signals: SOL showing bullish breakout pattern
• Market Cycle: Currently in Growth/Expansion phase
• Strategic Recommendations: Good for measured accumulation
```

### **Personalized Insights**
```
User: "What do you recommend for me personally?"
Dexter: 🎯 **Your Personalized DeFi Insights**
• Welcome back! I remember you're intermediate level with moderate risk tolerance
• Based on our 7 conversations about yield farming, I recommend:
  1. Compound USDC lending (8% APY) - matches your conservative approach
  2. ETH/USDC LP on Uniswap V3 - concentrated range for efficiency
  3. Set alerts for RSI oversold conditions - aligns with your technical interest
```

### **Adaptive Education**
```
User: "Explain impermanent loss like I'm a beginner"
Dexter: 🌊 **Impermanent Loss - Simple Explanation**
• Imagine you put 1 ETH + $2,000 USDC in a pool
• If ETH doubles, you'd have less total value than just holding them separately
• It's "impermanent" because if prices return to original levels, the loss disappears!
• Think of it as the price you pay for earning trading fees
• Pro Tip: Start with stablecoin pairs which have minimal impermanent loss
```

### **Smart Alerts**
```
User: "Set smart alerts for volatile conditions"
Dexter: ✅ **Advanced Alert System Activated!**
• Monitoring: BTC RSI >80, ETH volatility >8%, SOL volume spikes >200%
• AI Features: Pattern recognition, correlation analysis, sentiment tracking
• Smart Notifications: Only high-confidence signals to avoid spam
• System active and learning your preferences!
```

### **Social Content Creation**
```
User: "Create engaging social content about DeFi"
Dexter: 📱 **Content Generated:**
🔥 DeFi isn't just growing - it's revolutionizing finance! TVL up 150% this year while traditional banks struggle with 2% rates. We're not just early to DeFi, we're building the future. What's your biggest DeFi win this year? 🚀
