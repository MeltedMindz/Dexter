### 2. Balance Tracking for Leftover Tokens  
**Updates**: `contracts/core/DexterCompoundor.sol`

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… **Enhanced Balance Tracking**: Already existed, added utility functions
- âœ… **Get Account Balance**: `getAccountBalance()` view function
- âœ… **Withdraw All Balances**: `withdrawAllBalances()` for multiple tokens
- âœ… **Automatic Leftover Collection**: Compounds collect leftovers to user balances
- âœ… **Gas-Efficient Storage**: Minimal gas overhead for balance tracking

**Key Improvements:**
- Users can easily retrieve dust/leftover tokens from partial compounds
- Batch withdrawal functionality saves gas for multiple tokens
- Transparent balance tracking enhances user experience
- Prevents value from getting stuck in contracts

### 3. Stateless Utility Contract Pattern
**File**: `contracts/utils/DexterV3Utils.sol`

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… **Stateless Design**: No storage, purely functional for upgradeability
- âœ… **WhatToDo Enum**: Operation routing (COMPOUND, SWAP_AND_COMPOUND, CHANGE_RANGE, etc.)
- âœ… **Instruction Struct**: Complex operation parameters in single struct
- âœ… **TWAP Integration**: Built-in TWAP protection for utility operations
- âœ… **Multiple Operations**: Compound, swap, range changes, withdrawals
- âœ… **External Swap Support**: Framework for 0x/1inch integration
- âœ… **Gas Optimization**: Efficient approval handling and token management

**Key Improvements:**
- Redeployable utilities without affecting core contract
- Complex operations in single transaction
- Enhanced user experience with one-click operations
- Professional-grade architecture following Revert's proven pattern

### 4. Batch Operation Support
**File**: `contracts/core/DexterMultiCompoundor.sol`

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… **Batch Compounding**: Up to 50 positions in single transaction
- âœ… **Individual Parameters**: Custom settings per position in batch
- âœ… **Gas Management**: Configurable gas limits per position
- âœ… **Failure Handling**: Continue or stop on failure options
- âœ… **Result Tracking**: Detailed results for each position in batch
- âœ… **Opportunity Detection**: `getCompoundOpportunities()` identifies eligible positions
- âœ… **Gas Estimation**: Estimates gas costs before execution
- âœ… **Auto-Compound All**: `compoundAllEligible()` for user's positions

**Key Improvements:**
- Massive gas savings for users with multiple positions
- Professional batch processing with comprehensive error handling
- Intelligent gas management prevents transaction failures
- Enhanced automation capabilities for power users
