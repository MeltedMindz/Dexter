# Documentation

## Purpose
The docs directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Dexter Protocol, including architecture guides, API documentation, deployment instructions, implementation summaries, and analysis reports.

## What Lives Here
- **architecture/** - Technical architecture and system design documentation
- **api/** - API documentation and endpoint references
- **deployment/** - Deployment guides, production setup, and quickstart instructions
- **implementation-summaries/** - Summaries of completed implementations and integration work
- **analysis/** - Analysis reports and research documents
- **monitoring/** - Monitoring and observability documentation

## How It Fits Into the System
- **Documents**: All components of the Dexter Protocol (contracts, backend, frontend, infrastructure)
- **Supports**: Developer onboarding, deployment operations, and system understanding
- **Provides**: Reference material for architecture decisions, API usage, and operational procedures
- **Part of**: The complete knowledge base for the Dexter Protocol ecosystem

## Current Status
✅ **Active / In use** - Comprehensive documentation covering all major system components

## What This Is NOT
- This is not the code implementation (see `contracts/`, `backend/`, `frontend/` for actual code)
- This is not user-facing documentation (see root `README.md` for user-facing docs)
- This is not operational runbooks (those may be in private repositories)

## Relevant Docs / Entry Points
- **Architecture**: `architecture/README.md`
- **API Reference**: `api/README.md`
- **Deployment**: `deployment/README.md` and `deployment/QUICKSTART.md`
- **Root documentation**: See `../README.md`
- **Implementation summaries**: `implementation-summaries/` for completed work

## Documentation Structure
- **For Developers**: See `architecture/` and `api/` for technical details
- **For Operators**: See `deployment/` for setup and deployment guides
- **For Researchers**: See `analysis/` and `implementation-summaries/` for deep dives
- **For Users**: See root `README.md` for user-facing documentation
