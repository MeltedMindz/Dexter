Dexter ($DEX) represents the forefront of AI-powered liquidity management. Launched on the Virtuals Protocol, $DEX combines the innovative capabilities of AI agents with a sustainable tokenomics model, fostering community involvement and decentralized co-ownership.

#### **Launch on Virtuals Protocol**

The launch of $DEX on Virtuals Protocol employs a **fair launch mechanism** utilizing a bonding curve. This approach ensures equitable token distribution and mitigates risks such as bots and snipers hoarding tokens.

**Key Features of the Launch**

1. **Bundling Supply**:
   * 50% of the total $DEX supply is bundled during the bonding curve launch to prevent bots and snipers from grabbing a significant portion of tokens.
2. **Post-Launch Deflationary Mechanism**:
   * One hour after the launch, **30% of the total supply** (300,000,000 tokens) will be permanently burned. This strategic burn reduces supply and benefits both early adopters and long-term holders.
3. **Community Incentives and Ecosystem Growth**:
   * **15% of the total supply** is allocated to a vesting contract with a 24-month linear unlock schedule. These funds will support community incentives, marketing, and ecosystem development to ensure long-term sustainability and growth.
4. **Core Team and Treasury Vesting**:
   * **5% of the total supply** will be locked in separate vesting contracts, split between the core team and treasury. This ensures alignment with the protocol's long-term success.

#### **Benefits of the Launch Strategy**

1. **Mitigating Snipers**:
   * The bundling mechanism safeguards against supply hoarding during the bonding curve launch.
2. **Incentivized Growth**:
   * Community incentives and marketing funds drive adoption and long-term ecosystem expansion.
3. **Governance and Development**:
   * Treasury and core team vesting align contributors and decision-makers with the project’s success.
