## Autonomous AI Liquidity Management for DeFi

Dexter is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to autonomously manage liquidity positions across decentralized exchanges. Through continuous learning from historical performance data, Dexter evolves its strategies to maximize returns while minimizing risk for liquidity providers.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We are building the most sophisticated AI-driven liquidity management platform in DeFi. Our goal is to capture significant total value locked (TVL) by delivering consistently superior returns through intelligent automation, advanced risk management, and continuous learning algorithms.
