# Dexter Protocol 🤖⚡

**The First AI-Native DeFi Infrastructure with Production ML Models**

> *"From $50K positions to $10M+ institutional vaults - Dexter's AI manages your liquidity 24/7 so you don't have to"*

Dexter Protocol represents a paradigm shift in DeFi: **actual trained machine learning models** deployed in production, managing real positions with **15-25% APR improvements** over manual strategies. Unlike typical "AI" projects that just use the buzzword, Dexter runs 4 continuously-training ML models that process live blockchain data every 30 minutes, making intelligent decisions about position rebalancing, fee optimization, and risk management.

**🎯 Why Dexter is Different:** While others promise AI someday, we ship it today. Our LSTM price prediction models achieve **>85% directional accuracy**, our auto-compounding saves **70-90% gas costs**, and our ERC4626 vaults are built for **institutional adoption** with battle-tested security patterns.
