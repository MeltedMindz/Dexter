# Pages

## Purpose
The pages directory contains Next.js page components that define the routes and pages of the frontend application.

## What Lives Here
- **create-position.tsx** - Page for creating new automated liquidity positions

## How It Fits Into the System
- **Interacts with**: Components (`../components/`), smart contracts via Web3
- **Depends on**: Next.js, React, Wagmi, Viem
- **Provides**: Page routes and user-facing pages for the Dexter MVP
- **Part of**: The frontend application, defining the application structure

## Current Status
🚧 **In development** - Core pages exist, full functionality in progress

## What This Is NOT
- This is not the reusable components (those are in `../components/`)
- This is not the MVP dashboard (that's in `../mvp/`)

## Relevant Docs / Entry Points
- **Create position page**: `create-position.tsx`
- **Frontend documentation**: See `../README.md`
- **Root documentation**: See `../../README.md`
